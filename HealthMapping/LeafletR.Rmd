This is a script to map with leaflet.js

Sources:
* Method
    - http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-leaflet-package-for-online-mapping-in-r/
    - https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/master/vignettes/leaflet.Rmd
    - https://jcheng.shinyapps.io/choropleth/
    - for simplifying polygons: http://www.r-bloggers.com/simplifying-polygon-shapefiles-in-r/
* Data
    - We will use the same data used in PlottingShapefile.Rmd
    - http://www.opendoorlogistics.com/downloads/
    
```{r}
#Load the required packages
require(leaflet)
require(maptools)

#Load the data
Postcodedata <- read.csv("data/postcode.csv")
set.seed(1)
Postcodedata$data <- rnorm(124, mean = 50, sd = 25)
hospitals <- read.csv("data/sitesfinal_Geocoded.csv")
UKpostcodes <- readShapeSpatial("shapefiles/opendata/Areas.shp")

#Since we are plotting this shapefile onto a webmap, we need to simplify the polygons in order for the rendering to be a bit quicker
#*This will be added later*

#Add the default leaflet map
m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

#Add UK postcode polygons
m %>% addPolygons(data = UKpostcodes, weight = 1, color = "white", fillColor = heat.colors(10, alpha = NULL))


```
