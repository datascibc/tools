This is a script which makes a GeoJSON file from the Hospitals list from NHS Choices that can be fed into a map on Github.

*Data
    - path: ./data/Hospital.csv
    - details (e.g. contact details/addresses) of Hospitals in the UK, incl. private hospitals
    - this file already contains latitude and longitude codes for the hospital sites! So no need to geocode
    - from: http://media.nhschoices.nhs.uk/data/foi/Hospital.csv

``` {r}
#Load the required libraries
library(rgdal)

#Load the data
hospitalsites <- read.csv("data/Hospital.csv", header = TRUE, sep ="Â¬", na.strings = "")

#Clean the data to remove the NA strings from coordinates
data_to_del <- hospitalsites[is.na(hospitalsites$Latitude),]
hospitalsites <- hospitalsites[!is.na(hospitalsites$Latitude),]

#Coerce the coordinates into a SpatialPointsDataFrame
hospitalsites.SP  <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = hospitalsites[,c(16,15)], data = hospitalsites[,-c(16,15)])

#Write the dataframe into a GeoJSON format
writeOGR(hospitalsites.SP, dsn = "hospitalsites" , layer = "hospitalsites.SP", driver = "GeoJSON")

#Rename the file to have the suffix .GeoJSON and move it to the map folder
file.rename(from = "hospitalsites", to = "map/hospitalsites.geojson")
```
