This is a script for plotting shapefiles in R using ggplot2.

In many areas of public health medicine, data may be better represented on a map as a choropleth--a thematic map in which areas are proportionally shaded/coloured according to the statistical variable being displayed, e.g. mortality rate, or disease prevalence. 

Here I show how to make a choropleth with UK postcode boundaries in R. I then overlay the map with some discrete coordinates, which could represent the site of some hospitals in the UK.


```{r}
#Load the required packages
require(rgdal)
require(maptools)
require(ggplot2)

#Load postcode lists
Postcodedata <- read.csv("data/postcode.csv")

#Generate test data
set.seed(1)
Postcodedata$data <- rnorm(124, mean = 50, sd = 25)

#Load some Geocoded Hospitals 
hospitals <- read.csv("data/sitesfinal_Geocoded.csv")

#Load the shapefile data from http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/handle/10672/553
GBpostcodes <- readShapeSpatial("shapefiles/GB_Postcodes/PostalArea.shp")
#Verify it loaded correctly
plot(GBpostcodes)

##This shapefile is in the British National Grid Projection OSGB1936 (EPSG:27700), so we need to convert it to the WGS84 coordinate reference system. However I have been having problems getting this to work because of the error message, reproduced below
#proj4string(GBpostcodes) <- "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +datum=OSGB36 +units=m +no_defs"
#GBpostcodes_WGS84 <- spTransform(GBpostcodes, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

#Plot the shapes using ggplot2
#GBpostcodes_WGS84 <- fortify(GBpostcodes_WGS84, region = "PostArea") #I keep getting this error "Error: TopologyException: Input geom 0 is invalid: Self-intersection at or near point -6.5346772511079969 58.098792701899775 at -6.5346772511079969 58.098792701899775"

#As a result, I will plot the shapefiles in its existing CRS, and force the lat/lon codes for the points into the same CRS
GBpostcodes <- fortify(GBpostcodes, region = "PostArea")

#Transform the hospitals coordinates into the British National Grid Projection OSGB1936 (EPSG:27700)
hospitals <- SpatialPoints(hospitals[,c("lon","lat")],proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
hospitals <- spTransform(hospitals,CRS("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +datum=OSGB36 +units=m +no_defs"))
hospitals.df <- data.frame(coordinates(hospitals))

map <- ggplot(Postcodedata) + 
  geom_map(map = GBpostcodes, aes(map_id = Label, fill = data)) + 
  expand_limits(x = GBpostcodes$long, y = GBpostcodes$lat)
map + geom_point(data = hospitals.df, mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat,fill = NULL,group = NULL), colour = "red", size = 1)
```

There are a number of problems with the shapefile used for the above plot:

1. The shapefile is huge: 40.1mb! Thus plotting takes forever
2. The shapefile has missed out Northern Ireland. So only displays Great Britain and not the entire UK
3. The shapefile uses the British National Grid Projection, and hence we need to workaround it if we have geocoded latitude and longitude coordinates in the WGS84 coordinate reference system.

Having a look around online, we find that there are other shapefiles that we can use, one that is maintained by Open Door Logistics at http://www.opendoorlogistics.com/downloads/

```{r}
#Load the required packages
require(maptools)
require(ggplot2)

#Load postcode lists
Postcodedata <- read.csv("data/postcode.csv")

#Generate test data
set.seed(1)
Postcodedata$data <- rnorm(124, mean = 50, sd = 25)

#Load some Geocoded Hospitals 
hospitals <- read.csv("data/sitesfinal_Geocoded.csv")

#Load the shapefile data from http://www.opendoorlogistics.com/downloads/
UKpostcodes <- readShapeSpatial("shapefiles/opendata/Areas.shp")
#Verify it loaded correctly
plot(UKpostcodes)

UKpostcodes <- fortify(UKpostcodes, region = "name")
map <- ggplot(Postcodedata) + 
  geom_map(map = UKpostcodes, aes(map_id = Label, fill = data)) + 
#  coord_map() +
  expand_limits(x = UKpostcodes$long, y = UKpostcodes$lat)
map + geom_point(data = hospitals, mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat,fill = NULL,group = NULL), colour = "red", size = 1)
```

The resulting plot from the second code chunk is much faster to render, and shows other parts of the UK (not just Great Britain), including Northern Ireland.
